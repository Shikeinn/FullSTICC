README

The concept of MTConnect is an exploration into the development process of a fully functioning web application. The foundation of MTConnect
 is to create an aforementioned web application that will contain the following: a login page, register page, search page, and map page. We
 designed in large part with Java and Java embedded software in order to show mastery of the language and its tools, as well as for 
efficiency. Other languages will be used, such as MySQL, Java's SQL embedded library, and a java web framework known as Vaadin. 
We employed the Web Framework Vaadin and the Project Management tool Maven in order to achieve all the fully functional web applications.
 We have tasked with developing the database, the information to go in it, as well as the pathways, were taken to organize and send that 
data to the front end efficiently and effectively. It is in this collaborative effort that we will learn how to efficiently and 
effectively write large scale software in order to bring to fruition, MTConnect.  We planned on using Eclipse IDE with Maven and Vaadin 
repositories in order to develop the pathways that connect to our database as well as the server that will eventually host this 
application. For all general hosting, we will be using Amazon Web Services, for the Front-End of the Web Application, as well as a 
proprietary MySQL server that will house the data necessary for the project. We used MySQL WorkBench for all administrator-level 
manipulations, like setting up dimension tables.
